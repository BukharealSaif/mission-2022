                Global Community</h1>
            <p>As a community, we tend to keep the video camera turned off by default and mainly rely on voice (if it's not a "silent" hangout) and the chat box. Screensharing is useful, but always optional. Be aware that once you stop screen sharing, you will have to manually turn off your video feed. Our hangouts are a safe space and everyone abides by a Code of Conduct.</p>
